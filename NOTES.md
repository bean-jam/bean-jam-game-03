# Notes

Create the GameManager and SignalBus singletons

Create a GhostSpawner to easily spawn multiple ghosts in the queue

Create text boxes that pop up on the "booth_touched" signal

Create a DialogManager to handle the text 

Add a set of dialog where characters tell you about their lives and you decide whether
they go to heaven or hell based on the ruleset which is currently active.
For example, if someone says they only ever ate fish on a Thursday but the rules say
anything but Friday is a sin... straight to hell buddy.
